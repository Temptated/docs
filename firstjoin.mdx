So you just joined **Pier Network** and you aren't sure what to do. You've come to the right place. Here are the top 3 things you should do when you first join.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Familiar with the Spawn" icon="wave">
    The first thing you should do is familiarize yourself with your surroundings when you first join. Take a moment to discover what's nearby. Check out the spawn, maybe even the NPCs around you. Talk to some players, create a team, etc.

      title="image.png"
      style={{ width:"84%" }}
    />

    <Tip>
      \*\*Tip: \*\*Try running commands like \*\*/koth\*\* to discover the King of the Hill!
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wilderness Teleport" icon="tree">
    Next, you will want to get out of spawn because you've probably already explored everything, or you were lazy and skipped that step and just want to move on.

    <Warning>
      \*\*Do not \*\*go out of spawn near the warzone! You will be killed immediately by geared players. Do this next step to ensure your safety!
    </Warning>
    To get out of spawn the most effective way without dying, type **/rtp**.

    This will bring up a menu like this:

    ![image.png](/images/image.png)

    Click on the \*\*Grass Block \*\*to the left. You should begin teleporting randomly.

    You should see a message like "_Randomly Teleporting_". After a few moments, you should be teleported into the wilderness and ready for the next step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Gear Up and Create a Claim!" icon="gear">
    Assuming you have some decent wood or stone gear now, you should claim land. Find a good spot where you can build in and run **/claim**. This should claim an area near you.

    Above is a diagram of an example claim I created

    Green particles should indicate the border of your claim. Inside your claim, players cannot hurt you, break or place blocks, etc.

    Only players you \*\*/trust \*\*will be able to access your storage, ring your bell, build or place blocks, pvp, or interact with anything in your claim

    Read more about the functions of your claim here -\> [https://help.pier.gg/lands](here)

    At any point you can run \*\*/land unclaim \*\*and unclaim the land you claimed if you believe the position is bad or whatever at your discretion
