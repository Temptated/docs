## How to Join Our Server

Joining our server is different for each client. Here's a step-by-step instruction on how to join for each version of Minecraft.

<Accordion title="MINECRAFT: Java Edition" icon="sparkles">
  <Steps>
    <Step title="Open up Minecraft">
      Open up Minecraft Launcher and go to the latest version. We always try to support the latest version so there's a high chance it works. If it doesn't, please tell a staff member.

      Once you've gone to the latest release on the dropdown menu of the Java Edition page, it should look like this:
