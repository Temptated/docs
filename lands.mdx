Welcome to our comprehensive guide for the **Lands Claiming Feature**! This system allows you to protect your builds, create nations, and engage in territorial gameplay.

## Quick Start Commands

<Check>
  All of the items below should be functional. **Please report any bugs you notice if you notice any!**
</Check>

<info>
  **Essential Commands:**

  * `/l` or `/land` or `/lands` - View your lands and nations
  * `/claim` - Claim the chunk you're standing in
  * `/nation` - Manage your nation settings
</info>

## Getting Started with Land Claims

### Your First Claim

When you're ready to protect an area:

1. **Stand in the chunk** you want to claim
2. **`Run /claim`** to claim that chunk
3. **Look for the bell** that appears - this marks the start of your claimed territory
4. **Open your barrel** to use your storage

```bash
/claim
# Claims the current chunk you're standing in
```

### Managing Your Claims

Use these commands to view and manage your claimed land:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Territory">
    **View Your Territory:**

    - `/land` - See all your lands and nations
    - `/l` - Quick shorthand for `/land`
    - `/lands` - Alternative command for viewing territories
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Claims">
    **Claim Management:**

    - `/claim` - Claim current chunk
    - `/unclaim` - Remove claim from current chunk
    - `/trust [player]` - Allow a player to build in your claims
    - `/untrust [player]` - Remove building permissions
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Understanding Claims

### Claim Storage System

Every player has a **claim storage** limit that determines how many chunks they can claim. You can check your current usage and limits through the `/land` interface.

### The Claim Bell

When you successfully claim a chunk, a **bell** appears to mark the beginning of your territory. This visual indicator helps you and other players understand where your claimed land begins and ends.

<warning>
  **Important:** Claims are chunk-based, meaning you claim entire 16x16 block sections at once.
</warning>

## Creating and Managing Nations

### Founding Your Nation

Ready to expand beyond individual claims? Create a nation to unite multiple players and territories:

```bash
/nations create <name>
# Example: /nations create "Northern Kingdom"
```

### Nation Management

Once your nation exists, use these commands to develop it:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Nations">
    **Essential Nation Commands:**

    - `/nation` - Access nation management menu
    - `/nation setcapital` - Set your nation's capital city
    - `/nation delete`- Remove nations

    ### Claim/Nation Map

    Before creating your nation, it is \*\*highly recommended \*\*that you check the nation map to ensure you know your surroundings. Do to this, simply type `/map`
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Advanced">
    **Advanced Features:**

    - `/nation ally [nation]` - Form alliances with other nations
    - `/nation enemy [nation]` - Declare rivalries
    - `/nation tax [amount]` - Set taxes for nation members
    - `/nation rank [player] [rank]` - Assign ranks to members
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Setting Your Capital

Your nation's capital is its heart. Choose your chunk wisely, make sure it's in a good, far away location.

```bash
/nation setcapital
# Sets the current location as your nation's capital
```

## Warfare and Conflict

Nations can engage in organized warfare using the war system:

### War Commands

```bash
/war declare [nation]    # Declare war on another nation
/war spawn               # Teleport to the enemy during a war
```

<danger>
  **War Consequences:** During wartime, enemy nations may be able to siege your territory or gain special advantages. Plan your defenses accordingly!
</danger>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"I can't claim this chunk"**

- Check if you have enough maximum claims left
- Verify the chunk isn't already claimed by another player
- Ensure you're not too close to spawn or other protected areas

**"My nation commands aren't working"**

- Make sure you have the correct permissions in your nation
- Verify you're using the exact command syntax
- Check if your nation exists and you're a member

**"I lost my claims"**

- Claims may expire after extended inactivity if you don't pay your ukpeep
- Contact an administrator if you believe there's been an error
- Regular play helps maintain your claims
